Hamster Brain -- An ADHD productivity helper

The site has been deployed through Render (*link below as image of logo*).

The homepage shows the three major parts of the site, being a task list tracker that holds a points rewards system that can be turned in for rewards (*coming soon*), a full planner for any scheduled events in your future you wish to add, and a community page that shows blog posts from users, testimonials, and sets a basis for communal help in your productivity journey. The homepage also holds a Pomodoro Timer at the bottom to assist in anything you may need an interval timer so you can make sure to take those brain breaks!
